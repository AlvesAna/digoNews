							<h3>Review</h3>
							<p style="margin-top: 25px;">  I think WhatsApp is great, it's a simple and objective application that fulfills its function in a majestic way, which is to send almost instant messages to people far from countries, so I just have to praise it for being a good app and that in my long 6 years I never had any problems with the app, congratulations to those involved</p>
