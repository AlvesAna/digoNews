							<h3>History</h3>
							<p style="margin-top: 25px;">YouTube was officially born on February 14, 2005, when the trio Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim registered the domain youtube.com. The three met when they worked at PayPal and left with money in their pockets when eBay bought the payments system.
								Chad studied design in Indiana, while Chen and Karim were graduate programmers at the University of Illinois. They were at a party when they discussed how difficult it was to watch videos on the internet back then. That's where the solution to all this was born.
								Chad became the first CEO and Chen took over as head of technology. Karim, on the other hand, returned to his studies and only remained as a shareholder, being even half forgotten nowadays. YouTube's first home has nothing to do with the current one. It only had tabs for bookmarks, messages, and your profile and didn't show anything on the home screen other than your login.
								
								And do you know what was the first video in the history of YouTube? he has only 18 seconds and it's just Karim doing a short vlog about elephants at the zoo.
