							<h3>About me</h3>
							<p style="margin-top: 25px;">Hi, my name is Rodrigo and i'm 15 years old. I don't remember how I found out about these apps but I'm sure it was by recommendation, these apps have definitely changed my life for the better, YouTube for example, I've been using it since I've known myself. and he was very useful in times of difficulty both with studies and with entertainment itself and I wouldn't change it for anything, WhatsApp was important and still is as much for sending important information to family and friends as for more serious things (like work, bag stuff and etc ), and thanks to him I can keep in touch with old friends who are in another school or another city, so I wouldn't trade him for anything either and last and not least Ifunny, what for but what he's the dumbest, doesn't take away the merit of having been very important in my life, especially in frustrating, depressive, boring moments or because it made me want to laugh.
								Thanks to these apps I haven't completely lost my sanity, my days have gotten better and my life has gotten a lot easier, because of that I say it again, I wouldn't trade them for anything.</p>
