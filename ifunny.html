							<h3>History</h3>
							<p style="margin-top: 25px;">The creator and owner of IFunny is FunCorp, which develops entertainment services and develops the FunTech industry. It was registered in 2004 in Cyprus, although it was founded by students from Penza. The young team was producing funny apps, but no project was as popular as IFunny.
								This community of memes and funny pictures appeared in 2011 – a year after a similar IdaPrikol app for iOS. The Russian version turned out to be very popular in Russia and CIS countries, so the developers decided to repeat its success in the North American market. Unlike AyDaPrikol, iFunny was designed for English speaking users and in 5 years it was able to become a full-fledged social media.
								The entertainment content viewing service was initially available in the form of iOS and Android apps that could be downloaded from the App Store and Google Play. Then, the web version started to catch up with them, which also gradually gained popularity. Residents of the United States actively posted, viewed and commented on funny photos. And, of course, they tagged the memes they liked using emoticons. A similar system of likes operated in AyDaPrikol.</p>

							<h3>Review</h3>
							<p style="margin-top: 25px;"> Ifunny, an app that you're looking for to distract yourself and have a good laugh, is simple and objective, not to mention that it contains a kind of acid humor and sometimes borders on the dark humor, but nothing that will traumatize you... I think, but ignoring that it's a good app and i don't have to complain</p>
